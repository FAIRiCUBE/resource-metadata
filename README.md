# resource_metadata
The purpose of this repository is to collect metadata information for the processing/analysis (a/p) resources of the project. 

To create the metadata file for a new a/p resource as well as to update an existing one use the dedicated [web application](https://fairicube-md.dev.epsilon-italia.it/). 

The created metadata file will automatically be published in the [FAIRiCUBE Catalogue](https://catalog.eoxhub.fairicube.eu/?.language=en) and will be queryable through [Knowledge Base Query Tool](https://fairicube-kb.dev.epsilon-italia.it/query-tool).

To ensure semantic harmonisation, some metadata elements are valorised by selecting values from corresponding codelists. Use the [Codelist change proposal template](https://github.com/FAIRiCUBE/resource-metadata/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=codelist_change_proposal.yml) for proposing updates to current codelists.
