It covered a study area in the North-East of the country.\r\n\r\nLabel data:\r\nThe Dutch agricultural land registration data from 2018 of the study area has been used as ground truth data. It contains the farm parcel boundaries and the planted crops. The full list of crops has been reduced to 76 major types that were at least present in the region and thought to be potentially recognisable from the feature data. Still, the labels are significantly imbalanced.",
